        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "We're going to roll it back and do it all over again, this time on the GPU! As always, we have provided some starter code for you, and your job is to fill in the missing code as specified by the `#TODO#` blocks in the code. You can either just work in the ipynb OR you can work locally with the various files in this folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Simulation Description (mostly repeated)\n",
        "The world is split into `NUM_REGIONS` different regions. Each region is filled with `COMMUNITIES_PER_NUM_SPECIES` different communities of each of the `NUM_SPECIES` different species. Each of the communities is intialized with this information and a `population` and a `growth_rate` which is all packed into a `Species_Community` struct (note that the struct is a tad different to support GPU computations). Note that the struct also contains additional variables which you may or may not need to use depending upon your implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "typedef struct {\n",
        "    int population;        // the population of a speciies\n",
        "    int food_collected;    // the food collected in the current time period\n",
        "    int region_of_world;   // region of this species community\n",
        "    int species_type;      // type of species for this species community\n",
        "    float growth_rate;     // growth_rate for this species community\n",
        "    bool flag;             // flag in case helpful to have one (you may not need this)\n",
        "    int helperi;           // flag in case helpful to have one (you may not need this)\n",

        "} Species_Community;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For `NUM_TIMEPERIODS` the simulation runs. At each time period all of the members of each species calls the `food_oracle` inorder for everyone to `gather_all_food`. After all food is collected we can `update_all_populations` based on the amount of food gathered. In order to do so we need to first `compute_local_population_share` which is the percentage of all species WITHIN A SINGLE REGION that belong to a given species. We can then use that to `update_community_population` for each community of each species based on 3 rules as listed in later sections of this document.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the simulation is done it prints out the populations of the various communities of species.\n",

        "\n",
        "For a given community, update its population based on the input `local_population_share` and the following three rules:\n",
        "1. The change in population for a community is proportional to its growth_rate and local_population_share\n",
        "2. If it has collected enough food to feed the population it grows, else it shrinks\n",
        "3. If the population drops below 5 it goes extinct\n",
        "\n",
        "`compute_local_population_share` (0.5 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns the population share for a given community. Population share is defined as the percentage of population in a region that is a given species across all communities of all species.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we'll implement the overall population update step: \n",
        "\n",
        "`update_all_populations` (2.5 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "Updates the population for all communities of all species. Some quick hints/notes:\n",
        "1. You will need to use compute_local_population_share and update_community_population\n",
        "2. Make sure your logic is thread safe! Remember when you launch a kernel every line of the code is run by every thread in parallel!\n",
        "3. Feel free to use helper functions if that makes your life easier!\n",
        "\n",
        "Next we'll implement the food gathering step:\n",
        "\n",
        "`gather_all_food` (2.5 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "Each simualtion step we reset the food counts to 0 and then each member of the population tries to collect food using the food_oracle(). **On the GPU you are free to use whatever threading pattern you want!**\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we'll implement the main kernel\n",
        "\n",
        "`population_dynamics_kernel` (2 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a bit more complicated than the CPU but the premise is the same -- you want to do all NUM_TIME_PERIODS of gather_all_food and update_all_populations. However, as we are on the GPU, you'll want to use shared memory to speed things up, but then make sure to save things back to RAM once you're done!\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we'll launch the main kernel from the main function:\n",
        "\n",
        "`population_dynamics` (2 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that we need to be careful about GPU vs. CPU memory! So set up GPU memory, run the kernel, and clean up GPU memory!\n",

        "## Submission\n",
        "Once you are done, download and submit (or just submit if you are working locally) your `util.h` file to **Courseworks**! As we do not have an autograder we can't use Gradescope.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notes and Hints\n",
        "+ **DO NOT CHANGE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS** or you will break our grading scripts\n",
        "+ See the syllabus for our course collaboration policy (long story short you are welcome to collaborate at a high level but please do not copy each others code).\n",
        "+ If you are working in Colab, you can change the formatting of the code to different color schemes: just change the `%%cpp -n <filename>.h -s xcode` to a different `-s` flag. The list can be [found at this link](https://gist.github.com/akshaykhadse/7acc91dd41f52944c6150754e5530c4b).\n",
