# parallel-disease-simulation
This project focuses on developing a parallelized population simulation to study natural selection and the dynamics of species interactions within an ecosystem by leveraging CPU parallelism, thread processing control, and inter-process communication techniques. The goal is to create a computationally efficient representation of ecological systems.
