# parallel-disease-simulation
This project focuses on developing a parallelized population simulation to study the dynamics of disease transmission within an environment by leveraging CPU and GPU parallelism, thread processing control, and inter-process communication techniques. The goal is to create a computationally efficient representation of a pandemic.
